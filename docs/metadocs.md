# Do you wonder how was this documentation created?

In this section you can find the technologies used to generate the documentation of the project. And a quickstart to run the local server in your machine.

## MkDocs

Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file. Start by reading the introductory tutorial, then check the User Guide for more information.

## Markdown extensions

    If you want to use the styling of these notes use the [Admonition](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/admonition/) extension.

We also use permalink extension to improve the url generated by the docs.
